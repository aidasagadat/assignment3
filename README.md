Ramen Shop Management System.


The goal of our project is to create a web service of an online ramen store with which users can purchase different kinds of ramens,
that provides convenient user menu, and effective product management. 
The store has many ramen types of which user can choose one and order.
There will be such functionalities as: adding a ramen, checking for its availability and deleting it and etc.

Target audience:
Our online product store is aimed at a wide range of consumers, 
including busy people who need to save time on trips to the store,
as well as people who prefer a convenient way to buy products online.

Key features of the system:
User-frienly menu system
Adding and deleting ramens, checking for their availability (deleting them if availability = false)

Exception Handling Strategy:
Many exceptions may occur while running the program.
We cannot comprehend them all now, while the system is not completely ready.
But here are some possible exceptions we could think of:
1) OutOfStockException
For example person may want to purchase a ramen that is out of stock. In this situations, there should be a notAvailableException that will throw a message "Ramen is out of stock".
and etc.
